# lucifer0x17

gm gm gm!!!

i am **Ayush** and my screen name is **lucifer0x17**.

a backend and infrastructure developer and i am a curious person who love to read and understand stuff.

i am a ***contribut000r [@0rbit](https://x.com/0rbitco/) ðŸ’«***

i have been in crypto since 2022 and am still here because I have always believed in the community driven building and yeah the tech is cool.

i am a lazy and clumsy guy who loves to live in the terminal and prefers nature and starry skies over city lights.

i focus on optimizing performance and scalability.

i am a big fan of open source, though I used its products more than contributed to it :)
